# Print Multiples: Instructions

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.

Follow these rules:

1. If the number is a multiple of three, print `X is a multiple of 3`
2. Otherwise, if the number is a multiple of 5, the program should print `X is a multiple of 5`
3. Otherwise, just print the number.

For the 'X' in rules 1 and 2, print the number, not 'X', so if the number was 42, then `42 is a multiple of 3`.

## Expected Results

Run your program and check that it is working correctly. There are no unit tests to check your work for you.

Here's what the first ten lines of output should look like:

```
1
2
3 is a multiple of 3
4
5 is a multiple of 5
6 is a multiple of 3
7
8
9 is a multiple of 3
10 is a multiple of 5
```

## Extension

If the number is multiple of both 3 and 5, print "X is a multiple of 3 and 5" instead.
